        BrandedStructure should keep its members alive.

        Normally, each type of JSCell would have its own structure (and therefore, its own
        ClassInfo, MethodTable, etc), which would have handled visiting m_parentBrand.
        Similarly, it would have its own destructor, which would deref m_brand.

        However, the design of BrandedStructure is not like other JSCells.  As present,
        we have chosen to go with having BrandedStructure look exactly like a regular
        Structure, except that its isBrandedStructure flag is set to true.

        This design has advantages because we do checks all over the system for whether
        a cell is a Structure by simply comparing its structureID to structureStructure's
        structureID.  By virtue of BrandedStructure having the same structure as Structure,
        none of this code need to change.

        The downside is that we need to enhance Structure's methods to check if it is
        actually working on an instance of BrandedStructure, and do some additional work.

        This patch fixes 2 bugs:

        1. m_parentBrand was not visited by visitChildren().

           Structure::visitChildrenImpl() now calls BrandedStructure::visitAdditionalChildren()
           to handle this.

        2. m_brand needs to be ref'ed.

           In Structure::setBrandTransition(), if the BrandedStructure is a dictionary,
           then its m_transitionPropertyName will be cleared.  m_transitionPropertyName
           was the only means by which the UniqueStringImpl pointed to by m_brand was
           ref'ed.  The fix is to make m_brand a RefPtr.

           Hence, it follows that we also need to deref m_brand on destruction.
           Structure's destructor now calls BrandedStructure::destruct() to handle this.
