        More aggressive scheduling during early page load seems like a win.

        * NetworkProcess/NetworkLoadScheduler.cpp:
        
        Reduce from six to two.

        * NetworkProcess/NetworkResourceLoader.cpp:
        (WebKit::NetworkResourceLoader::startNetworkLoad):

        This revealed an issue where allowing scheduling for synchronous XHR can end up in a deadlock
        (since the web process won't be able to process redirect requests).
