        Add RTCRtpSFrameTransformer::setMediaType to allow setting the authentication size.
        In case mode is H264/VP8 and media type is audio, set back mode to none.

        [css-flex] Make {main|cross}SizeForPercentageResolution() return booleans instead of actual sizes
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223377

        Reviewed by Manuel Rego Casasnovas.

        These two methods were only called by childLogicalHeightForPercentageResolution() and they either returned
        WTF::nullopt or the overridingContentLogicalHeight(). We could simplify a bit the code by returning a boolean
        which means whether the overriding content logical height should be used to resolve a percentage or not. Apart
        from changing the return value we're also improving the naming so it becomes obvious that we are dealing with
        flex items and not the flex container.

        We're also removing some comments in those methods that were not really accurate.

        No new tests as there is no change in functionality.

        WebCore::ThreadGlobalData should not initialize fields eagerly
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=223481

        Reviewed by Chris Dumez.

        ThreadGlobalData is used in various cases. For example, WebCore::Timer uses it, and
        this is even also used in GPUProcess. We observed something (e.g. EventNames, QualifiedNameCache etc.)
        is initialized even in GPUProcess just because GPUProcess's audio stack uses WebCore::Timer.

        This patch makes these fields lazily-allocated to avoid initializing eagerly in the threads that
        are not interested in DOM etc.
