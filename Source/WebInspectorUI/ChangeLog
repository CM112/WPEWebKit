        * UserInterface/Views/GraphicsTabContentView.js:
        (WI.GraphicsTabContentView.prototype.initialLayout):
        It appears that it's possible for re-entrancy issues in the `WI.View` system since the
        `_didInitialLayout` flag isn't set until _after_ `initialLayout` returns, meaning that if
        the logic inside `initialLayout` triggers a synchronous `layout` then that second `layout`
        won't know that it's already in the middle of an `initialLayout`. In this case, showing the
        `WI.GraphicsOverviewContentView` causes the navigation sidebar to be shown, which forces a
        synchronous `layout` from handling `WI.Sidebar.Event.WidthDidChange`. For now, there's no
        "rush" to show the `WI.GraphicsOverviewContentView` so we delay it by one event loop turn.

        There's no reason to have another `WI.DropZoneView` here since there's already one that

        Web Inspector: Regression (r270134) Timeline recordings 2 and beyond do not show a timescale.
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=222930

        Reviewed by Devin Rousso.

        When a new `TimelineOverview` is created, it calls `TimelineOverview.prototype._viewModeDidChange` inside the
        constructor, which in turn called `updateLayout`. This was problematic in that a `TimelineRuler` would have
        `sizeDidChange` invoked before it was attached to the DOM, which meant that there was no width to cache. Because
        `sizeDidChange` is only invoked during the first layout and on resize events, the cached width is not updated
        when the ruler is attached to the view hierarchy, having already performed an early initial layout.

        This patch now checks if the `TimelineOverview` has performed its initial layout before updating the layout
        inside `_viewModeDidChange`, which means that the initial layout on the child `TimelineRuler` will be done while
        attached, thus producing a valid width value to cache.

        This patch fixes the broken CPU instrument when viewing a JSON timeline recordng.

        This exception is thrown when viewing a timeline recording that has been
        imported from JSON file. Aside from the exception, the code is functionally
        broken in this situation since passing a negative number to Array() doesn't work.

        I tested this change manually and selection ranges now behave as expected, and
        have not regressed in other instruments / UI.

        * UserInterface/Views/CPUTimelineView.js:
        Based on my investigation, the visibleEndTime is incorrectly computed when
        showing a JSON timeline recording because the currentTime property is always '0'.
        If this is the case, then let's assume that the entire range should be displayed.
