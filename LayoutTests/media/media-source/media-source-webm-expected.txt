This tests the ability of the SourceBuffer to reset the parser after an abort(). A SourceBuffer in this state should be able to accept a new initialization segment or a new media segment.

RUN(video.src = URL.createObjectURL(source))
EVENT(sourceopen)
RUN(source.duration = loader.duration())
RUN(sourceBuffer = source.addSourceBuffer(loader.type()))
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.initSegment()))
EVENT(update)
Append a media segment.
RUN(sourceBuffer.appendBuffer(loader.mediaSegment(0)))
EXPECTED (resizeEventFired == 'true') OK
EXPECTED (videoWidth == '320') OK
EXPECTED (videoHeight == '240') OK
END OF TEST
