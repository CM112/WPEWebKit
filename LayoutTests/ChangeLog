        REGRESSION(r216096): [GTK] Test accessibility/gtk/menu-list-unfocused-notifications.html is failing since r216096
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171598

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        Since r216096 the notification for menu list changes is deffered, so we need to wait one run loop cycle to get
        the notifications. Also update the test to ignore notifications that are not interesting like AXLoadComplete and
        AXElementBusyChanged, and update expectations for the new behavior with ATSPI where the notification is emitted
        on the menu and not the combo.

        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237315

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        This is because the test contains platform specific behavior for ATK that was migrated to ATSPI by mistake. We
        should behave like all other ports now.

        [ATSPI] Remove layout tests checking children added/removed notifications
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=237272

        Reviewed by Adrian Perez de Castro.

        Children changed notifications are not expected by any other tests because other ports don't support them. We
        already have unit tests to ensure they work as expected so we can just remove the layout tests and ensure we
        don't emit those notifications either.
